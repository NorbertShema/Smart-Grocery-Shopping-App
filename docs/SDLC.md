## SDLC Framework

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) will provide a structured approach to developing the Smart Grocery Shopping App, this will be ensuring that each phase contributes to building a functional, user-friendly, and scalable solution of the smart grocery app. Below is a high-level explanation of how each SDLC phase applies to this project.

#### Planning:

This phase involves defining the objectives and feasibility of the app. Since the app is designed for busy individuals, home cooks, and health-conscious users, the planning stage will focus on understanding their needs. Key questions include what features will be essential (such as recipe-based shopping lists, budgeting tools, and diet tracking), identifying competitors, and estimating costs and timelines. A feasibility study ensures that the app can successfully address the problem of grocery shopping inefficiencies.
